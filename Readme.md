A "hello world" alexa skill built in Rust using [alexa_rust](https://github.com/arienmalec/alexa_rust) and [aws-lambda-rust-runtime](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-rust-runtime).

I mostly followed [Rust Runtime for AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/rust-runtime-for-aws-lambda/) and [Building Alexa Skills in Rust](https://medium.com/@amalec/building-alexa-skills-in-rust-4cf54a497ea4),
and connected the missing dots in between.
